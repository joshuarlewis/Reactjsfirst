# Reactjsfirst

The file react.html is just short bits of React.js code elements that I feel should work with Joyce's php poll. I've struggled with React.js and seem to only get it to run when it wants, not when I want. These components seem to work under most circumstances and will run when I want (accept the clock :-) for the most part. Good luck everyone!!!
